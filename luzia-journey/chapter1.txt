Context (audio): Luzia just arrived at a special spot in the desert. It took her 18 days. A very long adventure, where she met several people, and her journey took many twists and turns. She is going to explain her journey.

Luzia (audio): First, I left home with my supplies. 
I followed the map closely, but I quickly realized that the desert was very different than what I expected. 
The heat was unbearable, and the sand got into everything. 
I met a man on the first day, who told me that I was crazy to try to cross the desert alone. 
He said that I would never make it, and that I should turn back. 
I didn't listen to him, and I kept going. 

I met several other people on my journey, some of whom helped me, and some of whom tried to harm me. 
I will tell you who I met next:

I met a woman on the second day. She was also trying to cross the desert. She was very tired and she had been walking for days. I offered her some of my water, and we talked for a while. She told me that she was trying to get to her family, who lived on the other side of the desert. 
She had been walking for weeks, and she was very tired. I offered to help her, but she said that she needed to do it alone. 
She told me that if I helped her, she would never make it to her family. 
I didn't listen to her, and I helped her anyway. 

We walked together for days, until we finally reached her family. 
They were so happy to see her, and they welcomed me into their home. 

I stayed with them for a while, and then I continued on my journey. 

I met a man on the fourth day. He was also trying to cross the desert. He was very tired and he had been walking for days. I offered him some of my water, and we talked for a while. He told me that he was trying to get to his family, who lived on the other side. You wouldn't believe it, but he was also trying to get to the other side of the desert! We walked together for days, until we finally reached his family. They were so happy to see him, and they welcomed me into their home. 

I stayed with them for a while, and then I continued on my journey.

On the seventh day, I met a woman. She was also trying to cross the desert. She was very tired and she had been walking for days. I offered her some of my water, and we talked for a while. She told me that she was trying to get to her family, who lived on the other side of the desert. 
She had been walking for weeks, and she was very tired. I offered to help her, but she said that she needed to do it alone. 
She told me that if I helped her, she would never make it to her family. 

I listened to her this time, and I didn't help her. 

I continued on my journey, and I finally reached the other side of the desert. 

It was a very long and difficult journey, but I made it. And here I am, at the most holy of places: the Temple of the Sun.

I will tell you about the temple of the sun:

The Temple of the Sun is a very special place. It is a place where the sun shines all year round, no matter what the weather is like outside. It is a place of healing, and many people come here to pray and to ask for help. 

I am going to stay here for a while and rest. I have been walking for days, and I am very tired. I will stay here until I have the strength to continue on my journey.

Context (audio): Suddenly, the ground starts shaking, and Luzia realizes that she is not alone.

Luzia (audio): What is happening?

Context (audio): There is a loud noise, and then a man appears. He is wearing a hood, and he is carrying a staff.

Luzia (audio): Who are you? What do you want?

Man (audio): I am the guardian of this temple. I am here to protect it from harm.

Luzia (audio): I am not here to harm the temple. I am just here to rest.

Man (audio): You are not welcome here. You must leave.

Luzia (audio): Please, let me stay. I am tired and I need to rest.

Man (audio): I am sorry, but you must go.

Luzia (audio): Fine. I will go.

Context (audio): Luzia leaves the temple and continues on her journey. She is tired and she doesn't know where she is going. She is walking for days, and she is getting very tired. She comes to a fork in the road, and she doesn't know which way to go. She is about to give up, when she sees a light in the-

Man (audio): Breathes in.

Luzia (audio): What is that?

Man (audio): It is the light of the temple. You must follow it.

Luzia (audio): But why?

Man (audio): Because it will lead you to the temple.

Luzia (audio): Thank you. I will follow it.

Context (audio): Luzia follows the light, and it leads her to the temple. She is tired and she doesn't know what to do.

Luzia (audio): Is this the temple?

Man (audio): Yes, it is.

Luzia (audio): I don't know what to do.

Man (audio): You must enter.

Luzia (audio): Why?

Man (audio): Because it is your destiny.
