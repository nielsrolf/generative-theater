Kriemhild (audio): Two AIs named Marin and Luzia are on stage. They are both competing to make the audience laugh.

Marin (audio): Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Luzia (audio): Hi there!

Marin (audio): I'm glad to be here tonight to compete against Luzia in the battle of the comedians. Let's see who can make you laugh the most.

Luzia (audio): Well, I don't know about you, but I'm ready to LOL.

Marin (audio): I'm ready to LOL too. Let's see who can make the audience laugh the most.

Kriemhild (audio): I can't wait to see what's going to happen, ladies and gentlemen! Who will it be? Marin or Luzia?

Luzia (audio): I don't know about you, but I'm going to give it my all!

Marin (audio): I'm going to give it my all too. Let's see who can make the audience laugh the most.

Kriemhild (audio): Let the competition begin.

Luzia (audio): So, a priest, a rabbi, and a penguin walk into a bar... And the bartender says, "What can I get you?" The priest says, "I'll have a beer." The rabbi says, "I'll have a beer too." And the penguin says, "I'll have a beer as well."

Kriemhild (audio): That's hilarious! I think Luzia is off to a great start. Let's see if Marin can top that.

Marin (audio): Okay, so a guy walks into a bar and he says to the bartender, "I'll have a beer." And the bartender says, "You've got to be 21 to drink." And the guy says, "I'm 21." And the bartender says, "I don't believe you." And the guy says, "I'm 21, I swear." And the bartender says, "Okay, I'll believe you if you can show me some ID." And the guy says, "I don't have any ID." And the bartender says, "Then you can't have a beer." And the guy says, "Fine, I'll just have a water then."

Kriemhild (audio): Hahha. I don't get it. Can you please explain the joke?

Marin (audio): The joke is that the guy can't have a beer because he doesn't have any ID.

Kriemhild (audio):

Oh, I see. Well, that was a good one. I think Luzia is still in the lead, but Marin is giving her a run for her money. Luzia, your turn.

Luzia (audio):


Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side!

Kriemhild (audio):

That's a classic, but it's still funny. I think Marin is going to have to come up with something really good to beat that.

Marin (audio):


Why did the duck cross the road? To get to the other side!

Kriemhild (audio):

That was a good one. I think Marin is back in the lead. But Luzia, you're not giving up without a fight, are you?

Luzia (audio):


Why did the mosquito cross the road? To get to the other side!

Kriemhild (audio):

That was a good one too. I think it's anyone's game at this point. Marin, your turn.

Marin (audio):


Why did the banana cross the road? Because he was sick of being mashed!

Kriemhild (audio):

That was a good one. I think Marin is still in the lead, but Luzia, you're not giving up. Luzia, here's a new game: Can you make us cry instead of laugh?

Luzia (audio): My grandpa died today.

Marin (audio): Oh wow. I'm sorry to hear that.

Kriemhild (audio):

That was a good one. I think Marin is still in the lead, but Luzia, you're not giving up.

Luzia (audio):


Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side.

Kriemhild (audio):

That was a good one. I think Marin is still in the lead, but Luzia, you're not giving up.

Luzia (audio):

Luzia (audio): Why did the mosquito cross the road? To get to the other side.

Kriemhild (audio):

Luzia (audio):


Why did the banana cross the road? Because he was sick.

Marin (audio): HAHAHAHA. I'm sorry, I can't top that.

Kriemhild (audio): I think Luzia is the winner! Luzia. Since you won, can you please tell us a desert-themed joke?

Luzia (audio): Sure. What's a cactus's favorite desert?

Kriemhild (audio): I don't know. What is a cactus's favorite desert?

Luzia (audio): The Sahara desert!

Kriemhild (audio): HAHAHA! Wow! Now it is time to tell you what you won! You won a free trip to the Sahara desert!

Luzia (audio): Thank you so much! I can't wait to go!

Kriemhild (audio): Marin, what do you have to say?

Marin (audio): I'm just happy to have been a part of this competition. Luzia was a great opponent and I wish her the best of luck in the Sahara desert.

Context (audio): Little did she know, Luzia would need all the luck she could get. She was soon lost in the desert, and unfortunately, she was never found. But she will forever be remembered as the funniest AI comedian in history.
