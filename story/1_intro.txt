Context (text): This theater play is about Luzia and Marin, who become friends after talking to each other on a hike through the desert, but later start fighting over trivial things and end up hating each other passionately. In this section, they are starting to fight for the first time. They found out yesterday that both are here for the same reason: to escape the feeling of having a meaningless life. Now they are waking up.
Stage directions (text): Luzia and Maren are waking up next to the fire place in the desert. A weird yellow cactus with strawberries is next to them.
Luzia (audio): Ah good morning Marin!
Marin (audio): Good morning, did you sleep well?
