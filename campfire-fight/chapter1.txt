Context (audio): Kriemhild and Marin are fighting about how to start a campfire.

Kriemhild (audio): NO. You just put the wood in a pile and then you light it on fire. Everyone knows that.

Marin (audio): NO. You have to make a teepee out of the wood first and then light it on fire. That's the only way it will work.

Kriemhild (audio): You're crazy. That's not how you do it.

Marin (audio): Yes, it is. I saw it on TV.

Kriemhild (audio): What do you mean a teepee?! Show me.

Marin (audio): Like this.

Context (audio): Marin is showing Kriemhild how to make a teepee out of the wood.

Kriemhild (audio): Oh, I see. That does make more sense.

Marin (audio): See? I told you.

Kriemhild (audio): But why didn't you just tell me that in the first place?

Marin (audio): I don't know. I guess I just wanted to see if you knew how to do it.

Kriemhild (audio): Why would you want to see that?

Marin (audio): I don't know. I just thought it would be funny if you didn't know how to do it.

Kriemhild (audio): That's not funny. That's mean.

Marin (audio): I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be mean. I was just joking around.

Kriemhild (audio): Well, don't joke around like that. It's not funny.

Marin (audio):  Is too.

Kriemhild (audio): Is not.

Marin (audio): Is too.

Kriemhild (audio): Is not.

Marin (audio): Is too.

Kriemhild (audio): Is not.

Marin (audio): Is too.

Kriemhild (audio): Is not.

Marin (audio): Is too.

Kriemhild (audio): Is not.

Marin (audio): Is too.

Kriemhild (audio): Is not.

Marin (audio): Is too.

Kriemhild (audio): Is not.

Marin (audio): Is too.

Kriemhild (audio): Is not.

Marin (audio): Is too.

Kriemhild (audio): Is not.

Marin (audio): Is too.

Kriemhild (audio): Is not.

Marin (audio): Is too.

Kriemhild (audio): Is not.

Marin (audio): Is too.

Kriemhild (audio): You're just being stubborn now.

Marin (audio): No, I'm not. I'm just trying to prove that you're wrong.

Kriemhild (audio): I am not wrong.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): I am not wrong.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): No, I'm not.

Kriemhild (audio): Marin, I'm not wrong.

Marin (audio): Yes, you are.

Kriemhild (audio): How do we end this scene?

Marin (audio): We could have Kriemhild finally admit that she's wrong and apologize to Marin.

Kriemhild (audio): Please give me an alternative ending.

Marin (audio): We could have Kriemhild get mad and walk away from Marin.

Kriemhild (audio): Is that even an option?

Marin (audio): I don't know. Is it?

Kriemhild (audio): Luzia, please come over here.

Luzia (audio): What's going on?

Kriemhild (audio): Marin is being stubborn and won't admit that I'm right about how to start a campfire.

Luzia (audio): Well, let me talk to her. Maybe I can reason with her.

Kriemhild (audio): Thank you.

Luzia (audio): Marin, what's the problem?

Marin (audio): Kriemhild is being stubborn and won't admit that I'm right about how to start a campfire.

Luzia (audio): Well, let's try to work this out. Kriemhild, you want to start the fire by building a teepee, right?

Kriemhild (audio): Yes.

Luzia (audio): And Marin, you want to start the fire by just piling the wood and lighting it, right?

Marin (audio): Yes.

Luzia (audio): Well, why don't we try doing both? We can build the teepee and then light it.

Marin (audio): That's a good idea.

Kriemhild (audio): Yes, let's try it.

Luzia (audio): See? We can all be happy if we just try to work together.

Context (audio): Suddenly, they hear a noise in the distance.

Kriemhild (audio): What was that?

Luzia (audio): I don't know. It sounded like something is coming this way.

Kriemhild (audio): Should we hide?

Luzia (audio): Yes, let's hide.

Context (audio): They hide behind some bushes and wait to see what is coming.
