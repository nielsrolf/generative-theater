Context (audio): The following is a dialogue between three people: Luzia, Kriemhild, and Marin. They are discussing what the most important thing is about comfortable pyjamas. They disagree on a lot of points, and their discussion escalates into a big fight.

Luzia (audio): 

The most important thing about comfortable pyjamas is that they are made of soft, lightweight material that will keep you cool and comfortable all night long.

Kriemhild (audio): 

That is not the most important thing at all! The most important thing about comfortable pyjamas is that they are loose fitting and allow your skin to breathe.

Marin (audio): 

You are both wrong! The most important thing about comfortable pyjamas is that they are made of natural fibers that will absorb moisture and keep you dry all night long.

Luzia (audio): I hate to say it, but I think you're both wrong. The most important thing about comfortable pyjamas is that they are made of soft, lightweight material that will keep you cool and comfortable all night long.

Kriemhild (audio): You're just saying that because you're too lazy to care about anything else!

Marin (audio): And you're just saying that because you're too vain to care about anything else!

Luzia (audio): Well, I think we can all agree that the most important thing about comfortable pyjamas is that they are made of soft, lightweight material that will keep you cool and comfortable all night long.

Marin (audio): Fuck you, Luzia.

Kriemhild (audio): Fuck you too, Marin.

Luzia (audio): Fuck you both. I'm going to bed.

Context (audio): Suddenly, Kriemhild starts to cry.

Luzia (audio): Oh, Kriemhild, don't cry. I'm sorry we fought.

Kriemhild (audio): I'm not crying because we fought. I'm crying because I realized that you're right. The most important thing about comfortable pyjamas is that they are made of soft, lightweight material that will keep you cool and comfortable all night long.

Marin (audio): Fuck you, Kriemhild.

Kriemhild (audio): Fuck you too, Marin.
