Context (audio): The following are 5 different descriptions of two characters who are doing a talk about survival skills. Each talk focuses on a different skill. The character's names are Luzia and Marin.  Luzia and Marin are stranded in the desert. Marin is exhausted and Luzia is sometimes. This delusional state that they are in is why they have  started giving these abstract talks. At the end of each monologue, there is an unexpected twist!

Context (audio): 1) Luzia and Marin are teaching us how to find water in the desert. Luzia explains that the human body is made up of mostly water and that we need to drink it in order to survive. She then goes on to say that the best way to find water is by looking for cacti. Cacti store water in their leaves and can be a lifesaver in the desert! Marin, who has been quietly listening up until this point, suddenly interrupts Luzia and says that the best way to find water is actually by digging a hole in the ground. He explains that there are underground rivers all over the desert and if you dig deep enough, you will eventually hit one! Here's the twist: Marin is actually correct! Luzia is so surprised that she faints!
