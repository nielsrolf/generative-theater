Context (audio): 1) Luzia and Marin are teaching us how to build a fire. They tell us that building a fire is essential when you're stranded in the desert. The first thing you need to do is find a spot that's clear of any vegetation. Then, you'll need to gather some wood. The best kind of wood to use is dry, dead wood that's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. Once you have your wood, you'll need to create a teepee-shaped structure with it. Then, you'll need to light the teepee on fire using a lighter or matches. Once the teepee is lit, carefully place some larger pieces of wood onto the fire. Keep adding wood to the fire as needed, and make sure to keep an eye on it so that it doesn't get too big or out of control. However, if you do find yourself in a situation where your fire has gotten out of control, the best thing to do is just let it burn itself out. Here's the twist: Luzia and Marin are actually in a burning building, and the fire is getting out of control. Luzia is delusional and thinks that they're in the desert, so she continues to give tips on how to build a fire. Marin is trying to get her to snap out of it, but it's too late. The building collapses on top of them and they both die.
